# 905. Sort Array By Parity
# Given an integer array nums, move all the even integers at the beginning of the array followed by all the odd integers.
# Return any array that satisfies this condition.
 
# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [3,1,2,4]
# Output: [2,4,3,1]
# Explanation: The outputs [4,2,3,1], [2,4,1,3], and [4,2,1,3] would also be accepted.

# Example 2:
# Input: nums = [0]
# Output: [0]

nums = [3,1,4,6,4,5,89,37]
